 * @brief  Various intialization routines, including a number
 * that read values from the parameter files
 *
 * ### Notes ###
 *
 * Because the input and setup of Python is relatively complex,
 * we have over time moved much of this out of main into
 * subroutines, and we have generally tried to collect
 * related portion of the initialization into different setup
 * routines, such as setup_disk or setup_files.
 *
 * This file contains a collection of these setup routines,
 * that either stand-alone or have not been moved into their
 * own files.

 * Originally, DFUDGE was the only number used to push through
 * boundariies, but today DFUDGE is used sparingly, if at all,
 * as push through distances within wind cells are defined
 * differently for each cell.
 *
 * There are two competing factors in defining DFUDGE.  It
 * should be short enough so that the push through distane
 * goes only a small way into s cell.  It should be large
 * enough though that round-off errors do not prevent one
 * from actually getting into a cell.
